1. Explain, in your own words, the 2 things resource interfaces can be used for (we went over both in today's content)

  Interface is used to specify some requirements when you want to implement something. Also, it is possible to use it to restrict exposure to certain things to specified people.


2. Define your own contract. Make your own resource interface and a resource that implements the interface. Create 2 functions. In the 1st function, show an example of not restricting the type of the resource and accessing its content. In the 2nd function, show an example of restricting the type of the resource and NOT being able to access its content.

3. How would we fix this code?
