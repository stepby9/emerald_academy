Quests:
  1. It's a decentralized data storage, where there is no need for a thirtd party that can guarantee trust and security. Data is stored in blocks. Blockchain is used to facilitate transactions, recording them and providing transparency.
  2. Smart contract is basically the code that is executed when certain conditions are met. As it is on blockchain, there is no need for a third party to execute the contract, which means it is impossible to manipulate the smart contract in someone's favour (unless you are a good coder and can create a loophole that will not be identified by any audit :D).
  3.Script is used for viewing data, and it's free (I hope it stays like this :D). Transactions create new data or change it, and of course it means you need to pay for that (smart contracts don't work for free, that would be outrageous ;))
