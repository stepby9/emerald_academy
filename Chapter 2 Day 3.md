    1. In a script, initialize an array (that has length == 3) of your favourite people, represented as Strings, and log it.

    2. In a script, initialize a dictionary that maps the Strings Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, and LinkedIn to a UInt64 that represents the order in which you use them from most to least. For example, YouTube --> 1, Reddit --> 2, etc. If you've never used one before, map it to 0!

   3.  Explain what the force unwrap operator ! does, with an example different from the one I showed you (you can just change the type).
   We need to use it to unwrap the optional to get the actual type.

   4. Using this picture below, explain...
        What the error message means
        Why we're getting this error
        How to fix it

We are getting an optional instead of a string, and we need to force unwrap it. So to add "!" after thing[0x03]
